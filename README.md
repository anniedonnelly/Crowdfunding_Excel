# Crowdfunding 

1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns? <br>
- Theater campaigns are usually the most successful campaigns, nut they are also among the most failed.
- The best goal range to have a campaign at is between $1000-$15000.
- To be successful campaign it needs to be theater, film & video, and music.<br> 
2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?<br>
<br>One of the big limitations about this dataset is that it is unknown how the campaigns were promoted, or if it wasnâ€™t. The adds to the limitation of not knowing what made a campaign successful or not. Another limitation is that majority of the campaigns take place in the US. It seems to me that the use needs to part of a separate dataset than the other countries.<br>
3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Campaign outcomes based on country of origin
- Outcome based on time allotment 
- Does staff pick or spotlight affect outcome
