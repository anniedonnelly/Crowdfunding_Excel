1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns? <br>

* Theater campaigns are usually the most successful campaigns, nut they are also among the most failed.
* The best goal range to have a campaign at is between $1000-$15000.
* To be successful campaign it needs to be theater, film & video, and music.<br> 
<br>
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?<br>
<br>One of the big limitations about this dataset is that it is unknown how the campaigns were promoted, or if it wasn’t. The adds to the limitation of not knowing what made a campaign successful or not. Another limitation is that majority of the campaigns take place in the US. It seems to me that the use needs to part of a separate dataset than the other countries.<br>
<br>
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? <br>

* Campaign outcomes based on country of origin.
* Outcome based on time allotment.
* Does staff pick or spotlight affect outcome.
